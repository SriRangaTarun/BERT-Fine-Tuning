## Quora Insincere Classification ðŸ¤”
A roBERTa base model finetuned on the [Quora Insincere Questions](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification) dataset from Kaggle. I build a model based on Facebook AI's roBERTa base to classify questions on Quora as sincere or insincere. Flagging insincere questions and comments online is a great way to combat trolls at scale.
