# BERT-Fine-Tuning
A collection of python notebooks showing how to solve various NLP tasks by fine-tuning BERT in PyTorch.
The first notebook is based on data from the [Kaggle Quora Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/quora-insincere-questions-classification). It can be run on Google Colab. You need a Kaggle account and a Kaggle API token to access the required data to run this BERT fine-tuning experiment.
